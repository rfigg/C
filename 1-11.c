/*
Test with variety of normal word counts, boundaries of large and small or none.
Bugs might come from
-large files or large words (overflowing counts)
-bad char values from getchar
*/

/*
Book answers I liked:
Going from no input, to 1 char 1 word, up, etc
just newlines, or just blanks, tabs, and newlines
one word per line - no blanks or tabs
word starting beginning of line and after some blanks
